-- Version history --

Certain updates only apply to the web version, but they should be obvious to
figure out since they are likely modification of the interface.

prinseq-lite-0.20.4:
Fixed error caused by empty lines at the end of paired-end datasets. Restricted
sequences in graph data complexity statistics output to 1000bp to keep the .gd
files small for inputs with very long sequences (e.g. whole genomes).

prinseq-lite-0.20.3:
Fixed issue of incorrect duplicate counts when a sequence is both an exact
duplicate and reverse complement exact duplicate of another sequence.

prinseq-lite-0.20.2:
Added support for STDOUT output to paired-end processing.

prinseq-web-0.20.1:
Release of web version files to run the web version on a local machine.

prinseq-lite-0.20.1:
Fixed issue with FASTA inputs that caused the program to exit.

prinseq-lite-0.20:
Fixed depricated use of 'defined' on aggregates. Added options "trim_left_p" and
"trim_right_p" to trim reads by a percentage value in addition to options that
trim by number of nucleotides. Added option "stats_assembly" to report N50, N90,
etc contig size in the standalone version's summary statistics output. Added
support for paired-end data (new options "fasta2" and "fastq2").

prinseq-graphs-0.6 / prinseq-web-0.20:
Added support for paired-end data.

prinseq-lite-0.19.5:
Fixed issue of incorrect quality trimming with arguments "min" and "max" for
option -trim_qual_type.

prinseq-lite-0.19.4 / prinseq-graphs-0.5.1:
Fixed issues related to the use of qw() in loops for Perl version 5.14+ (thanks
to Evan Staton for pointing out the issue and providing the link with details:
http://search.cpan.org/~jesse/perl-5.14.0/pod/perldelta.pod
#Use_of_qw%28...%29_as_parentheses ). Fixed issue with 5'/3' duplicate removal
that forced option -exact_only (thanks to Stephanie Pierson for reporting the
issue). Fixed issue with missing duplicate statistics in graph data output if
-derep or -graph_stats was not specified. Suppressed output of PCA module when
generating PCA plots.

prinseq-lite-0.19.3:
Added new output file option to keep track of sequence identifier renaming
(option -seq_id_mappings). Fixed trim_qual_rule parameter listed twice in the
log file. Fixed issue with sequences of length 3bp when calculating DUST scores.
Fixed issue with exact_only parameter check.

prinseq-lite-0.19.2:
Increased memory efficiency for graph data calculation on big input files.

prinseq-lite-0.19.1:
Fixed rounding issue in sequence complexity calculation.

prinseq-lite-0.19 / prinseq-graphs-0.5:
Added check for counts of filtered sequence to report when no sequences were
filtered. Optimized dinucleotide calculation (~400% faster), sequence complexity
calculation (~80% faster) and quality filtering and trimming (~90% faster when
both filtering and trimming). Added option (-graph_stats) to select what
statistics should be calculated and included in the graph_data file (useful if
you e.g. do not need sequence complexity information, which requires a lot of
computation). Added binned base quality data to graph data output (as generated
in web version up to 0.17.4). Removed annotations from length distribution graph
if standard deviation is zero.

prinseq-lite-0.18.3:
Fixed phred64 scaling issue for graph data outputs (thanks to Komal Jain for
pointing out the issue).

prinseq-lite-0.18.2:
Fixed typo in selection of graph data elements that resulted in missing quality
data.

Fixed missing zero count for Ns when generating graphs data file. Fixed
duplication count table output for HTML report.

processing (same as already available in web version). Added option to input
parameters saved in a file (lite). Fixed issue with output to STDOUT for
"-out_format 4" option. Added counts by type for filtered sequences to verbose
output (lite). Updated layout of HTML report to match web version and to use
less colors to reduce printing costs and increase readability (graphs).

prinseq-web-0.18:
Fixed issue with spaces and parenthesis in filename when compressing files.
Switched from Sencha to JQuery for front-end javascript. New web frontend fully
relying on lite and graphs Perl scripts (all further lite and graphs updates
will automatically apply to the web version).

prinseq-lite-0.17.4:
Fixed issue with MID tag output when using the -graph_data option.

prinseq-lite-0.17 / prinseq-graphs-0.2:
Added error message if statistics and graph data are generated at the same time.
Prevented generation of graphs for missing data that might otherwise generate
errors. Prevent the use of -stats outputs when generating graphs data. Added
example data for prinseq-graphs. Fixed issue with filenames containing a
non-alphanuerical sign after the period sign (thanks to Marmaduke for pointing
out the issue). New option -no_qual_header allows to reduce the file size of
FASTQ files by preventing any header information output for the quality data.
New option -derep_min to specify the duplication threshold (e.g. only filter
sequences that occur more than 5 times).

prinseq-web-0.16.1

"until" to "while" (web only, lite version is not affected).

Check if sequence qualities are in Phred+64 format, if specified. Added the
reporting of errors during processing of data. Multiple output formats are now
supported (prinseq-lite). Extended the input format from ACGTN to full nucleic
acid ambiguity code (ACGTURYKMSWBDHVNX-). Allow processing of amino acid
sequences (prinseq-lite). Replace option -si13 with -phred64 to specify input
files in Phred+64 format. New options to generate graphs in standalone lite
version (using prinseq-graphs.pl or online form).

duplicates.

prinseq-web-0.13 / prinseq-lite-0.13:
